## Objectives 
Total Vehicles: The analysis identifies the total number of electric vehicles (EVs) in the market, encompassing Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs).
Average Electric Range: provides insights into the state of technological advancements and energy efficiency in the industry. Benchmarks for range efficiency are identified, offering a glimpse into consumer preferences and technological priorities.
Total BEV Vehicles and % of Total BEV Vehicles: Analysis explores the potential drivers behind BEV market share, including price, range, and availability.
Total PHEV Vehicles and % of Total PHEV Vehicles: Total PHEV count is assessed, with calculations for their market share within the EV segment.

## Data Description 
The dataset used for this analysis includes comprehensive information about electric vehicles in the U.S. market. Key aspects of the data include:

Vehicle Specifications:
Attributes such as make, model, year, and manufacturer help establish the variety and diversity of EVs in the market.
Technical details like battery capacity, electric range, and charging speed contribute to evaluating Average Electric Range and benchmarking technological advancements.

Market Segmentation:
Categorization into BEVs (Battery Electric Vehicles) and PHEVs (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles) enables calculations for Total BEV Vehicles and % of Total BEV Vehicles as well as Total PHEV Vehicles and % of Total PHEV Vehicles.
Vehicle class and size segments provide insights into consumer preferences and potential niche markets for Elysium.

Performance Metrics:
Data on energy efficiency, such as miles per kWh, is relevant for assessing Average Electric Range and identifying technological leaders in the market.
Information on acceleration and top speed allows us to identify performance-oriented EV models.

Geographic Distribution:
Registration data segmented by state and region provides context for Total Vehicles, highlighting areas where there is higher endorsement and approval rates of EBV's which in turn shows potential growth opportunities.

Temporal Data:
Year-over-year growth in EV registrations supports understanding of Total Vehicles by showing market trends and growth rates.
Historical trends in average electric range provide context for the Average Electric Range KPI, highlighting improvements over time and consumer demand for range extensions.



## Data insights/Results  

Total Vehicles:
The total number of EVs in the dataset is 150.48k, with BEVs making up 117k (78%) and PHEVs 34k (22%).
Tesla leads the market with 69k vehicles (45.8% of the total EVs), but it only produces BEVs, highlighting its dominance in the fully electric segment.

Notably, the total number of EVs grew by an impressive 328% from 2020 to 2023, indicating exponential market growth and increasing consumer acceptance.This underscores the expanding opportunities in the market for new entrants like Elysium. The total vehicles in the market in 2024 is only showing 1k as Dataset is limited till the first month of the year. 

Average Electric Range:
The average electric range of EVs is 67.8 miles, significantly influenced by limited data availability on battery performance and Clean Alternative Fuel (CAF) data.

Market Segmentation:
The PHEV market is more evenly distributed, with Chevrolet contributing 5k PHEVs. This indicates a more balanced competitive landscape in the hybrid segment.

Geographic Distribution:
Almost all EVs in the dataset are concentrated in Washington State, accounting for 150.1k vehicles. This demonstrates regional dominance and adoption trends.

## Recommendations
Focus on BEV Development:
Leverage Tesla’s dominance in the BEV segment to identify key features driving their success which can be looked into by the R&D Department. Elysium should prioritize BEV models to align with the growing market preference for fully electric vehicles.

Enhance Electric Range:
R&D can look in to improving electric range, as the current average (67.8 miles) is a limitation for market competitiveness. 

Target Regional Opportunities:
Given the dominance of EVs in Washington State, Elysium should consider launching in this region to capitalize on existing infrastructure and market acceptance.

Capitalize on Market Growth:
The remarkable 328% growth in total EVs from 2020 to 2023 highlights the urgency of entering this booming market. Elysium should put more resources in product development and launch to capture this upward momentum.

Expand PHEV Market Share:
With a relatively balanced competitive landscape in the PHEV segment, Elysium has the opportunity to establish itself the PHEV market.
